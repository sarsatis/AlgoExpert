1)Created Program for nth fibonacci
	There are 3 solutions for it. For each solution single test case file is written just change the class name to test
2)Created Program for productsum and its appropriate test cases :- Check for test case 2 very intresting
	Could not complete all the test cases but have written down question and result
3)Created Program for permutation and its appropriate test cases :- Check for test case to compare 2 array result very good
3)Created Program for powerset and its appropriate test cases :- Check for test case to compare 2 array result very good only solution 1 is better i.e iterative way
